## Overview

E-scooters have transformed urban mobility, but reckless riding poses significant safety risks. My Master's thesis explores the application of **computer vision** to detect **dangerous riding behaviors**, such as **multiple riders on a single e-scooter**.

The project was done as part of my studies at Uppsala University together with [Voi Technology](https://www.voi.com/), a leading e-scooter sharing company in Sweden.

## ðŸ”¬ Research Highlights:
- Developed a **YOLOv4-based object detection model**, achieving **93.89% mAP** for e-scooter recognition.
- Trained **CNN-based image classification models**, with a **DenseNet-121 model** reaching an **F1 score of 81%** in detecting unsafe rides.
- Created a **custom e-scooter dataset** and applied **transfer learning** to enhance detection accuracy.

## ðŸŽ¯ Why It Matters:
By identifying dangerous behaviors in real time, this research contributes to **improving road safety and shaping future e-scooter regulations**.
