## Overview

This console program finds all of the possible combinations of '+' and '-' operators which can be used in-between the given lists
of numbers to reach the given targets. The input numbers are read from the `inputs.txt` file and can be separated by spaces,
commas or equal signs. The last number in each line is considered to be the target number.

Example input: `17 3 2 5 = 23`

Output: `17 + 3 - 2 + 5 = 23`

An example input file has been provided in the repository.

In general the code complexity here is `O(2^n)`, where  `n` is the number of missing operators to find,
because all of the possible combinations are checked. However, some `O(n)` checks are used before evaluation
to check if the given list of numbers is even worth evaluating.

This console program is built using the `.NET Core 3.1` framework.
