## Overview

Text embeddings are a type of text representation that allows text with similar meanings to have similar representations. This project aims to explain and visualize how text embeddings work, and why they are essential for modern Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.

This project consists of a Python backend, and a Next.js frontend. The user can get embeddings and low dimension representations of the embeddings. The low dimension representations of the embeddings can be viewed in 2D or 3D plots. The project includes Clerk for authentication and PostHog for analytics. See more details and full code in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ReinisS/embedding-visualizer).
