## Overview

I built a portfolio website for my girlfriend using Astro (starting from the [sorollaportfolio template](https://github.com/jramma/sorollaportfolio)), Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript. The website showcases her projects, skills, and contact information. The website is fully responsive and optimized for performance and SEO.

## Website

You can the Portfolio Website at [trusmiati.com](https://trusmiati.com/).
