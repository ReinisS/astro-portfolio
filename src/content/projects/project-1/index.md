## Overview

This work-in-progress project aims to visualize a Spotify playlist in a 2D or 3D map. The idea is to use the Spotify API to get the audio features of each song in the playlist and then use dimensionality reduction techniques to visualize the playlist in a 2D or 3D plot. The user can then interact with the map to see how the songs are clustered together based on their audio features.

This project is based on research done earlier during my studies at Uppsala University.
