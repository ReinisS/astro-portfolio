## Overview

This project is a ray tracing viewer that follows the ["Ray Tracing in a Weekend" book series by Peter Shirley](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html). The goal is to implement a simple ray tracer that can render spheres, planes, and other simple shapes with realistic lighting and shading. The project is written in C++ and uses the OpenGL library for rendering.

This project was done as part of a university project for the "Computer Graphics" course at Uppsala University.

## Demonstration

Here is a preview of an image rendered using the ray tracer:
